- Cost function: MSE = `(1/2m) * sum((y_pred - y)^2)`
- Gradients: `dw = (1/m) * X.T @ (y_pred - y)`, `db = (1/m) * sum(y_pred - y)`
- Update rule: `weights -= lr * dw`, `bias -= lr * db`

### Files
- `src/linear_regression.py` (LinearRegressionScratch class)

### Results
| Degree | Features | BIC      | AIC      | Val R²  |
|--------|----------|----------|----------|---------|
| 1      | 7        | -4023.50 | -4063.46 | 0.8484  |
| 2      | 35       | -3920.13 | -4099.98 | 0.8420  |
| 3      | 119      | -3452.07 | -4051.56 | 0.8333  |
| 4+     | 329+     | Exploded | Exploded | Negative|

### Key Learnings
- Polynomial features don't improve performance for this dataset
- Linear model (degree=1) is optimal by all metrics
- High-degree polynomials (4+) catastrophically overfit
- Gradient descent required careful learning rate tuning (lr=0.06 for degree=2)
- Normal Equation: θ = (X^T X)^-1 X^T y (instant, exact solution)

### Challenges Overcome
- Initial gradient descent diverged with lr=0.01 for 35 features
- Tested learning rates from 0.001 to 0.1
- Found optimal lr=0.06 for degree=2 polynomial (2000 iterations)
- Both implementations (Normal Equation & GD) matched sklearn perfectly

### Files
- `src/linear_regression.py` (added PolynomialRegressionScratch, PolynomialRegressionGradientDescent)

- Best alpha: 0.0001
- Training R²: 0.8451
- Validation R²: 0.8475
- Features: 7/7 (no feature elimination until alpha=10)
- Converged in ~18 iterations using coordinate descent
- Soft thresholding operator for L1 penalty

### Key Findings
- **Regularization doesn't help** - model is not overfitting

### Part 2: Error Analysis (2 hrs)

#### Residual Analysis
- Mean residual: -0.0073 (nearly unbiased)
- Std: 0.1485
- Min/Max: -0.6832 / 0.5002
- Distribution: Nearly normal with slight right skew
- Q-Q plot: Tails deviate slightly (outliers at extremes)
- Homoscedastic: Constant variance across predictions ✓

#### Worst 10 Predictions Analysis
- Worst error: House #134 (actual=$35,311, predicted=$69,922, error=-49.5%)
- 7 out of 10 worst are over-predictions
- 3 out of 10 worst are under-predictions

#### Pattern Identified: **Model Struggles with Low-Quality Houses**
Worst predictions vs all test houses:
- OverallQual: 5.2 vs 6.1 (-15.2%)
- GarageCars: 1.5 vs 1.8 (-15.8%)
- **FullBath: 1.1 vs 1.5 (-27.3%)**
- YearBuilt: 1946 vs 1973 (-1.4%)

**Conclusion:** Linear model breaks down for distressed/low-end properties.

---

### Part 3: Feature Insights (1.5 hrs)

#### Feature Importance (by absolute weight)
1. **GrLivArea**: 0.1494 (29.8% of total contribution)
2. **OverallQual**: 0.1288 (24.3%)
3. **YearBuilt**: 0.0864 (17.1%)
4. **TotalBsmtSF**: 0.0581 (10.6%)

## Day 7: Feature Engineering & Model Optimization
**Date**: January 14, 2026

### Part 1: Feature Engineering (5 hours)

#### Tasks Completed
- ✅ Created `src/feature_engineering.py` module
- ✅ Engineered 8 new features (interaction, ratio, composite)
- ✅ Tested models with 15 features (7 base + 8 engineered)
- ✅ Analyzed feature importance for engineered features
- ✅ Tested selective feature engineering (best 2 only)

#### Engineered Features
1. **Interaction Terms:**
   - Quality_Size = OverallQual × GrLivArea
   - Age_Quality = House_Age × OverallQual

2. **Ratio Features:**
   - Bath_Density = FullBath / (GrLivArea/1000)
   - Garage_Ratio = GarageCars / GrLivArea
   - Basement_Ratio = TotalBsmtSF / 1stFlrSF

3. **Composite Features:**
   - Total_Space = GrLivArea + TotalBsmtSF
   - House_Age = 2026 - YearBuilt
   - Is_New = Binary flag (built after 2000)

#### Results
| Model Configuration | Features | Test R² | Change |
|---------------------|----------|---------|--------|
| Base                | 7        | 0.8714  | baseline |
| All Engineered      | 15       | 0.8665  | -0.0049 |
| Selective (best 2)  | 9        | 0.8668  | -0.0045 |

**Key Finding:** Feature engineering decreased performance - base features are already optimal.

#### Feature Importance Analysis
**Top engineered features:**
- Quality_Size: 2nd most important overall (weight=0.066)
- Total_Space: 3rd most important (weight=0.047)
- House_Age: Redundant with YearBuilt (cancels out)
- Bath_Density: Negative weight (amplified multicollinearity)

---

### Part 2: Multicollinearity Resolution (1 hour)

#### Problem Identified
- FullBath has negative weight (-0.0207)
- Correlation with GrLivArea: 0.638
- Counterintuitive: more bathrooms = lower price?

#### Investigation
- Only 9 houses (0.6%) have 0 bathrooms
- FullBath distribution: mostly 1-2 bathrooms
- Multicollinearity confirmed

#### Solution Implemented
**Removed FullBath from feature set**

#### Results
```
Model Comparison:
  With FullBath (7 features):    Test R² = 0.8714
  Without FullBath (6 features): Test R² = 0.8718
  Improvement: +0.0005
```

**Final 6 Features:**
1. OverallQual (0.1262)
2. GrLivArea (0.1394) ← Most important
3. GarageCars (0.0462)
4. TotalBsmtSF (0.0602)
5. 1stFlrSF (0.0245)
6. YearBuilt (0.0810)

**All weights now positive** - multicollinearity resolved ✓

---

### Part 3: Cross-Validation Optimization (1.5 hours)

#### Problem Identified: Fold 7 Outlier
**10-Fold CV (no shuffle):**
- Mean R²: 0.8389
- Std: 0.0569 (high variance)
- **Fold 7: R² = 0.6799** ← Problematic

#### Investigation
Analyzed Fold 7 characteristics:
- Contains 131 houses
- OverallQual: -0.11 (15.2% below average)
- GrLivArea: -0.09 (smaller houses)
- YearBuilt: -0.06 (older houses)
- Price: $153k avg vs $166k overall

**Root Cause:** Sequential data split created cluster of low-quality houses in Fold 7. Linear model struggles with budget segment.

#### Solution Implemented
**Use shuffled K-Fold instead of sequential split**

#### Results
```
Cross-Validation Comparison:
  No Shuffle:  Mean=0.8389, Std=0.0569, Min=0.6799
  With Shuffle: Mean=0.8423, Std=0.0256, Min=0.7834
  
Improvements:
  - Std reduced by 55%: 0.0569 → 0.0256
  - Worst fold improved: 0.6799 → 0.7834 (+0.1035)
  - Mean improved: 0.8389 → 0.8423 (+0.0034)
```

**Fold 7 problem eliminated** ✓

#### Problem
Initial confidence intervals: 52.7% coverage (too low)

#### Solution: Data-Driven Calibration
Used actual disagreement distribution and residuals to set thresholds:

**Calibrated Thresholds:**
- High confidence: disagreement < 0.0228 (25th percentile)
- Medium: 0.0228 - 0.0673 (25th-75th)
- Low: > 0.0673 (75th+)

**Calibrated Margins:**
- High: ±0.1416 (covers 80% of errors)
- Medium: ±0.2219 (covers 90%)
- Low: ±0.3057 (covers 95%)

#### Final Coverage: 88.4% ✅
Meets industry standard (>85%)

**Distribution:**
- High confidence: 25.3% of predictions
- Medium: 49.3%
- Low: 25.3%

### Day 10 Summary

#### Key Achievements
1. ✅ Ensemble stacking: +0.93% over XGBoost
2. ✅ Calibrated confidence system (88.4% coverage)
3. ✅ Production-ready model saved to disk
4. ✅ Honest uncertainty quantification

#### System Design Insight
**Avoided switching models based on uncertainty** - ensemble already encodes this mathematically. Instead, used disagreement for confidence scoring (user-facing transparency).

#### Final Model Card
- Architecture: Linear + XGBoost → Ridge meta-learner
- Performance: 0.8833 R² (88.3% variance explained)
- Calibration: 88.4% of predictions fall within stated intervals
- Deployment ready: Serialized with preprocessing pipeline
